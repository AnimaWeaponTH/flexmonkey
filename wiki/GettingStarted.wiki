#summary Getting Started With FlexMonkey

= Preparing your application for testing =

Build FlexMonkey from source, or [http://flexmonkey.googlecode.com/files/FlexMonkey.0.1.swc download it]. Follow the instructions below. (FlexMonkey is configured just like [http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=LiveDocs_Book_Parts&file=functest_components2_128_03.html Quick Test Pro]).

Add FlexMonkey.swc to the compile path of the Flex app you want to test and recompile it with the following additional Flex compiler options:

{{{
-include-libraries "/YOUR_FLEX_INSTALLATION/frameworks/libs/automation_agent.swc" "/YOUR_FLEX_INSTALLATION/frameworks/libs/automation.swc" "/YOUR_APP_LIBS/FlexMonkey.swc"
}}}

If you're using Flex Builder, make sure the *Framework Linkage* on the *Flex Build Path* Library tab is set to *Merged into Code*. *automation_agent.swc* and *automation.swc* provide the [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/ Flex automation API] required by FlexMonkey.

Copy the file *FlexMonkeyEnv.xml* to the folder containing the swc of the application you're testing.

= Starting FlexMonkey =

Start your appliction. FlexMonkey is a Flex Mixin class and it launches itself when it's class is loaded. The compiler options above ensure that FlexMonkey is linked into your test app and that it gets loaded when your app runs.
