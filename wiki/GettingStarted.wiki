#summary Getting Started With FlexMonkey

= Setup =

Build FlexMonkey from source, or [http://flexmonkey.googlecode.com/files/FlexMonkey.0.1.swc download it]. Add FlexMonkey.swc to the compile path of the Flex app you want to test. Add the following Flex compiler options:

{{{
-include-libraries "/YOUR_FLEX_INSTALLATION/frameworks/libs/automation_agent.swc" "/YOUR_FLEX_INSTALLATION/frameworks/libs/automation.swc" "/YOUR_APP_LIBS/FlexMonkey.swc"
}}}

If you're using Flex Builder, make sure the *Framework Linkage* on the *Flex Build Path* Library tab is set to *Merged into Code*. *automation_agent.swc* and *automation.swc* provide the [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/ Flex automation API] required by FlexMonkey.

Copy the file *FlexMonkeyEnv.xml* to the folder containing the swc of the application you're testing.

Start your appliction. FlexMonkey is a Flex [Mixin] class and it launches itself when it's class is loaded. The compiler options above ensure that FlexMonkey is linked into your test app and that it gets loaded when your app runs.
