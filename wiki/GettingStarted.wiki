_Updated for FlexMonkey 0.6. To run with 0.5, see the [GettingStartedWithZeroDotFive old setup instructions]_

= Starting a FlexMonkey Session = 

Use !FlexMonkeyLauncher to record and playback !FlexMonkey tests for a swf.

[http://code.google.com/p/flexmonkey/downloads/list Download] and expand !FlexMonkey.0.6.zip. 

Copy *!FlexMonkeyLauncher.swf* from the *build* directory to the directory containing the swf you want to test. _Please note:_ The launcher *must* be run from the same directory as the swf to be tested. Copy *!RunTests.html* from the *wrapper* directory to this directory as well, and edit it so that it references the swf to be tested.

For example, to record UI interactions for !MonkeyContacts.swf, RunTests.html should look similar to the following:

{{{
<html>
<!-- 

Customize this file to pass arguments to FlexMonkeyLauncher:

targetSwf (required) - The name of the swf to be tested. It must reside in the same directory as FlexMonkeyLauncher.
testSwf - The name of the swf continaing your tests. It also must reside in the same place as FlexMonkeyLauncher.
visible - If false, the FlexMonkey window will not be displayed
targetHeight - The height to be set for the targetSwf.
targetWidth - The width to be set for the targetSwf.

The arguments are passed to !FlexMonkeyLauncher as flashvars. See http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=passingarguments_3.html
to learn more about setting flashvars. flashvars are passed by IE using the "param" tag. Other browsers use the "embed" tag. 
Specify both if you'll be testing in both browsers.

Open your modified !RunTests.html in a browser. Once your swf is loaded, you can start recording UI interactions by hitting the *Record* button. You can playback interactions by hitting the *Play* button on the *Command List* tab.
