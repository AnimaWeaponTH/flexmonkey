== How do I get help? ==

See the !FlexMonkey discussion board at http://groups.google.com/group/flexmonkey.

== How do I get started using !FlexMonkey? ==

See GettingStarted.

== How do I run my !FlexMonkey tests from Ant? ==

See RunningFromAnt.

== Why do I get the message "License not present. With the trial version only limited records are allowed"? ==
Flex Builder Standard edition provides a trial license of the [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/ Flex Automation API], which is the underlying mechanism used by FlexMonkey. Adobe does not currently seem to publicly document just exactly what limitations are imposed by the trial license. Flex Builder Professional provides a full license of the Flex Automation API. Hopefully Adobe will open source the Flex Automation API sometime soon....

== What's the difference between FlexMonkeyUI.swc and !FlexMonkey.swc? ==

First of all, FlexMonkeyUI.swc contains FlexMonkey.swc, so you don't need both! FlexMonkeyUI.swc includes the gui which is launched automatically upon app startup. If you don't want the gui (eg, you're playing back tests from Ant), use FlexMonkey.swc instead. You can run from ant with FlexMonkeyUI.swc, but the FlexMonkey window will open (which is typically benign, other than obscuring your view of your app as it responds to automation).

== Does !FlexMonkey work with custom components? ==

FlexMonkey works with most custom components that extend concrete Flex  
Components. Custom components that descend directly from UIComponent  
require special handling as explained in http://www.adobe.com/go/flex_automation_api.

== Where can I get the source for aggro.swc ==

aggro.swc provides the CollapsableTitleWindow component for FlexMonkey. You can download the source from http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&extid=1682522.

== Where can I get the source for !FlexSpy? ==

http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/

== Where can I get the source for !FlexUnit? ==

== What is !AutoQuick? ==

AutoQuick is a sample application from Adobe demonstrating the use of the Automation API. FlexMonkey is built on top of a slightly modified version of AutoQuick. (Learn [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/ more]).
