#summary FlexMonkey 0.6 User Guide

= Overview of the !FlexMonkey Framework =

Flexmonkey is comprised of two components:

 * *!FlexMonkey.swc* - A library providing the flexmonkey user interface, the recording and playback API, and a !FlexUnit test runner.

 * *!FlexMonkeyLauncher.swf* - An application that launches Flex applications for use with !FlexMonkey. You use the launcher both for recording tests as well as replaying previously recorded tests.

= targetSwfs and testSwfs =

By using the launcher, you can test any application without needing to link it with testing libraries or test case code. You package your test cases into a separate swf (the _testSwf_) that is loaded by the launcher dynamically along with your application (the _targetSwf_). 

= The !FlexMonkey user interface =

The flexmonkey user interface is used to:

 * Load testSwfs and targetSwfs
 * Record and playback user interactions
 * Generate source code for creating a testSwf

The interface is organized around the following components:

 * The *Record* button, which toggles on and off the recording of user interactions in the targetSwf.
 * The *Setup* tab, which can be used to interactively specify targetSwfs and testSwfs for loading, and which displays the currently loaded swf file names.
 * The *Command List* tab, which displays any captured user interaction commands, and provides for editing captured commands.
 * The *!TestCase Code* tab, which displays actionscript source generated from captured targetSwf user interactions.
 * The *!FlexUnit Runner* tab, which contains an embedded flexunit test runner.

= Loading a targetSwf into !FlexMonkey =

To load a swf for testing, copy !FlexMonkeyLauncher.swf to the directory containing the swf you wish to test, then launch !FlexMonkey.swf with the standalone flash player.

Enter the name of the swf you want to test in the *App to Test* field on the *Setup* tab and click the *Load SWF* button. The application should start and be displayed beneath the flexmonkey window.
