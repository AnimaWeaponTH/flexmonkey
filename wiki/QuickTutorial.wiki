#summary FlexMonkey Tutorial.

= Running the Sample Application =

This tutorial will walk through the features of flexmonkey by using it to test a simple contact manager application. You can start the application now by clicking [http://keystone.gorillalogic.com/~sstern/MonkeyContacts.html# here]. The source code and binaries can be downloaded [here].

The sample consists of the following components:

 * *!MonkeyContacts.mxml* - the source file for the Monkey Contact Application we'll be testing.
 * *!FlexUnitTests.mxml* - source code containing a test previously generated by flexmonkey.
 * *flexmonkey.swc* - the flexmonkey component library.

!MonkeyContacts.mxml contains no Flexmonkey-specific code. Any application can be tested with Flexmonkey without requiring any source code modifciations. However, we do need to link flexmonkey swc into our application's swf. The swf file included with the sample [download] already has flexmonkey linked in. (Learn [GettingStarted more]).

When you launch the !MonkeyExample.mxml application, its application window opens, and the FlexMonkey window opens automatically (via static initialization code. Learn [GettingStarted more]). You can mov and resize the Flexmonkey window as necessary to work with the contact manager app beneath it.

= Recording a Script =

Click the Record toggle button at the top of the screen. Now play around with the contact manager, which although primitive, offers a variety of UI gestures you can record. In addition to typing in the form, you can edit rows after they've been added to the grid, and the Phone Type field has a !ComboBox itemEditor. !Flexmonkey will faithfully record all UI events (many events such as mousemoves are filtered by default). Flexmonkey displays each recorded event as a command in the Command List. Clicking anywhere in the Flexmonkey window will stop recording.

= Playing Back a Script =

Click the Play button on the Command List window. Each recorded action will be replayed. By default, Flexmonkey pauses for a half second between commands to give each UI action time to complete.

You can play subsets of commands from the list by selecting them in the grid and then hitting Run. If no rows are selected, Flexmonkey will play all the commands. 

= Generating a FlexUnit Test =

Click on the FlexUnit TestCase tab to view the generated source code. You can copy and paste this code into a !FlexUnit !TestCase and add it to any !FlexUnit !TestSuite. 

= ScreenShot =

Click the *Show completeTestCase* checkbox and a complete !FlexUnit !TestCase will be generated.

After you copy and paste the generated code into an !ActionScript source file and add testing validations, you can rebuild the app (including Flexmonkey) and restart. The swf   the [download] already has the
