#summary FlexMonkey Overview

FlexMonkey is a unit testing framework for Flex apps that provides for automating the testing of Flex UI functionality. FlexMonkey can record and play back Flex UI interactions, and generates !ActionScript-based testing scripts that can easily be included within a continuous integration process.

FlexMonkey was donated by [http://www.gorillalogic.com Gorilla Logic] to the Flex Community.
